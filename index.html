            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Indian politician <b>Narendra Modi</b> was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar. He advanced through
                the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and <i><b>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</b></i>. From
                2001 to 2014, Modi presided as <i>Gujarat's chief minister</i>. He was appointed as India's 14th prime
                minister in 2014. Under his leadership, the emphasis has been placed on foreign policy endeavours,
                infrastructure development, and economic reforms. The <b>"Make in India"</b> initiative, which sought to
                increase domestic manufacturing, and Narendra Modi's strong leadership style have made him a
                divisive figure in Indian politics. During his administration, the economic expansion has
                received both praise and condemnation for its contribution to social and religious issues.</p>

                Terrorism is most serious challenge to open & pluralistic societies. Combating it requires collective
                effort. We need to target not only the terrorists, but also their entire supporting ecosystem.
                Our strongest action should be reserved for those state actors who employ terrorism as an
                instrument of State Policy. -PM Modi at the 11th East Asia Summit</q>
